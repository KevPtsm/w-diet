## Pricing Recommendations

### Option A: Premium Positioning (€19.99/month)

**B2C Pro:** €19.99/month or €199/year (€16.58/month, 17% savings)

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Matches MyFitnessPal Premium (industry benchmark)
- ✅ Aligns with Notion Business pricing (consultants pay this)
- ✅ Signals "professional tool" not "consumer app"
- ✅ Highest margin per user (€19.99 - €1.80 API costs = €18.19 profit = 91% margin)
- ✅ Enables €12-15/employee B2B pricing (bulk discount model)
- ✅ Room to offer promotions (first month €9.99, Black Friday 50% off annual)

**Risks:**
- ⚠️ Higher price = harder conversion (need strong free trial to demonstrate value)
- ⚠️ Unproven product (users might resist €20 for unknown app)

**Recommendation:** Start here, drop to €14.99 if conversion <20%

---

### Option B: Competitive Positioning (€14.99/month)

**B2C Pro:** €14.99/month or €149/year (€12.42/month, 17% savings)

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Matches Foodvisor (direct AI scanning competitor)
- ✅ Matches Evernote Starter (professional tool pricing)
- ✅ Lower barrier to entry than €19.99
- ✅ Still commands "premium" positioning vs Yazio/Lose It
- ✅ Good margin (€14.99 - €1.80 API costs = €13.19 profit = 88% margin)
- ✅ Enables €10-12/employee B2B pricing (still competitive)
- ✅ Easier to increase to €19.99 later (vs starting high and dropping)

**Risks:**
- ⚠️ Leaves €5/month on table if users would pay €19.99
- ⚠️ Less room for discounting

**Recommendation:** Safest starting point, increase after validation

---

### Option C: Budget Positioning (€9.99/month)

**B2C Pro:** €9.99/month or €99/year (€8.25/month, 17% savings)

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Matches Lifesum, Calorie Mama (mid-market pricing)
- ✅ Easier conversion (lower price = less friction)
- ✅ Still profitable (€9.99 - €1.80 API costs = €8.19 profit = 82% margin)

**Risks:**
- ❌ Signals "consumer app" not "professional tool"
- ❌ Destroys B2B pricing power (why would companies pay €10-12/employee if individuals pay €9.99?)
- ❌ Harder to raise prices later (users expect €9.99 forever)
- ❌ Less margin to reinvest in product development

**Recommendation:** AVOID - wrong positioning for consultant market

---

### Option D: Freemium with Usage Limits (€4.99/month)

**B2C Free:** 3 menu scans/week
**B2C Pro:** €4.99/month or €49/year (€4.08/month)

**Rationale:**
- ✅ Generous free tier reduces acquisition friction
- ✅ Low Pro price converts free users easily
- ✅ Still profitable (€4.99 - €1.80 API costs = €3.19 profit = 64% margin)

**Risks:**
- ❌ **DESTROYS B2B OPPORTUNITY** (companies won't pay €10-12/employee if individuals pay €4.99)
- ❌ Thin margins vulnerable to API cost increases
- ❌ Heavy users (100 scans/month) could lose money
- ❌ Wrong signal for professional market
- ❌ Can't raise prices later without user revolt

**Recommendation:** AVOID - fatal flaw for B2B strategy

---

## Final Recommendation: Phased Pricing Strategy

### Phase 1: POC (Weeks 1-10)

**B2C Pro:** €14.99/month with 7-day free trial

**Rationale:**
- Validate willingness-to-pay with PwC colleagues
- €14.99 is "safe bet" - proven by Foodvisor, Evernote
- Lower barrier than €19.99 for unproven product
- Gather conversion data to inform Phase 2 pricing

**Test During POC:**
- Ask users: "Would you pay €4.99, €9.99, €14.99, or €19.99 for this?"
- Track: Free trial → Pro conversion rate at €14.99
- Qualitative: "What price feels right for this value?"

---

### Phase 2: Public Launch (Weeks 11-18)

**IF POC conversion ≥30% at €14.99:**
- **Increase to €19.99/month** for new users
- **Grandfather existing users at €14.99** (loyalty reward)
- **Launch B2B tier:** €12/employee/month (justified by €19.99 B2C price)

**IF POC conversion <20% at €14.99:**
- **Drop to €9.99/month** temporarily
- **Add usage limits:** 50 scans/month (prevents margin erosion)
- **Iterate on value perception** before raising price

---

### Phase 3: Scale (Weeks 19-52)

**B2C Pro:** €19.99/month or €199/year
**B2B Corporate:** €12-15/employee/month (50+ employees)
**B2B Enterprise:** €10/employee/month (500+ employees, multi-year contract)

**Promotions:**
- First month: €9.99 (50% off - acquisition hook)
- Annual plan: €199 (17% savings vs monthly)
- Black Friday: 40% off annual (€119 for year)
- Referral: Both users get 1 month free
